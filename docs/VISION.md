# Vision

This file will be generated by running the vision-scan prompt.

## Project Context

Pantheon is a persistent world deity game with these locked design decisions:

- **World:** Sharded mega-worlds (100-1000 players per shard)
- **Combat:** Real-time but simplistic auto-battler style with playback
- **Offline:** Civilizations fend for themselves, conquering is slow (24-48hr sieges)
- **Seasons:** 2-3 month cycles, winners immortalized in pantheon

## To Generate

Run the vision-scan prompt in Claude Code to analyze this repository and generate ideas.
